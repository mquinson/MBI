<!--Function of the API
	"Name": specifies the name of the function.
	"return-type": the datatype returned by the function (use "void" for no type).
	"wrapp-everywhere": set this attribute to "yes" (without quotes) if this
	                    API should be wrapped on the application as well on
	                    ALL(!) tool places (Be careful not to wrapp APIs 
	                    used by the tool places to implement their own 
	                    functionality). [optional]
    "is-finalizer": set this attribute to "yes" if this call should cause a shutdown
                    of the tool once called on all application processes. [optional] 

    Rational: there is no such thing as a "is-init" option the first intercepted event
              will initialize the tool. If some communication mechanism is not yet
              available at this time a lazy initialization mechanism allows the 
              execusion to continue and events to be forwarded at a later point in time.
