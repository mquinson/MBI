    Runs the test on need. Returns True if the test was ran, and False if it was cached.
    
    The result is cached if possible, and the test is rerun only if the `test.txt` (containing the tool output) or the `test.elapsed` (containing the timing info) do not exist, or if `test.md5sum` (containing the md5sum of the code to compile) does not match.

    Parameters:
     - buildcmd and execcmd are shell commands to run. buildcmd can be any shell line (incuding && groups), but execcmd must be a single binary to run. 
     - cachefile is the name of the test
     - filename is the source file containing the code
     - binary the file name in which to compile the code
     - batchinfo: something like "1/1" to say that this run is the only batch (see -b parameter of MBI.py)
     - read_line_lambda: a lambda to which each line of the tool output is feed ASAP. It allows MUST to interrupt the execution when a deadlock is reported.
